# Viridian Belfry

Welcome to **Viridian Belfry** — a creative forge for ambitious, systems-driven games built with love and code. Founded by a solo developer, this space exists to bring to life bold game ideas that blend strategic depth with strong aesthetic identity.

## 🌿 About

Viridian Belfry is currently focused on developing **Alpha Instinct Royale**, a stylized auto-battler set in a mythic animal kingdom. This project aims to explore:

- ⚔️ Deep tactical gameplay with simultaneous action resolution  
- 🧠 Emergent strategies from unique unit abilities  
- 🏞️ Rich worldbuilding inspired by global fauna and folklore

Though this started as a solo effort, I believe the best games grow when more creative minds join the table.

## 🧩 Projects
