# Viridian Belfry

Hi — I’m a solo developer building games under the name **Viridian Belfry**.

Right now I’m working on **Alpha Instinct Royale**, a tactical auto-battler where mythic animals clash across a hex-grid battlefield. It’s inspired by the depth of strategy games, the expressiveness of character design, and the joy of watching unexpected moments emerge from smart systems.

This is still an early-stage project, but I’m designing it with long-term ambition in mind — something competitive, expressive, and fun to pick apart.

If that sounds interesting, feel free to explore the [main repo](https://github.com/ViridianBelfry/AlphaInstinct). I’d love to eventually grow this with other creative, curious people — whether you’re into game design, art, or just want to follow along.

Thanks for visiting.
